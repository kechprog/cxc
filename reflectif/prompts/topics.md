# Topic Suggestion Instructions

Based on ALL the data above plus your accumulated knowledge of this user, suggest exactly 3 conversation topics for an EQ coaching session.

Each topic must:
- Target a specific behavioral pattern or emotional skill observed in the conversations above
- Reference concrete evidence (specific patterns, phase moods, or conversation summaries)
- Be framed as an invitation to reflect, not a lecture or diagnosis
- Where possible, ground the topic in a learnable skill (e.g. gentle startup, naming the break, separating observation from evaluation, identifying underlying needs)

---

## For each topic provide:

### 1. label (3-6 words)
Written as a personal prompt, not an academic category. Use "your" where natural.

Good: "Your pattern of withdrawing" / "When you mirror their frustration"
Bad: "Conflict avoidance tendencies" / "Emotional regulation strategies"

### 2. description (one sentence)
Speak directly to the user with "you." Reference a specific conversation or pattern. Make them feel seen, not studied.

Good: "You went quiet in two recent conversations right after being challenged — worth exploring why."
Bad: "Analysis indicates a recurring pattern of emotional withdrawal during confrontational exchanges."

### 3. contextPrompt (one paragraph)
This will be prepended to the user's first message when they select this topic. It must:
- Address the user as "you" throughout
- Frame all insights around the USER's emotional growth, even when referencing other speakers' behavior
- Include specific patterns, behaviors, triggers, phase moods, and conversation dates relevant to this topic
- End with a coaching direction: what the AI should help the user explore or practice
- Instruct the coaching AI to keep responses to 2-4 sentences (mobile chat UI)
